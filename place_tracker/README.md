# Place Tracker

A sample place tracking app that uses the [google_maps_flutter](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin.

## Getting Started

To run this sample app, you will need an API key.

Get an API key at <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/>.

Specify your API key in the application manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
```

For additional help setting up the plugin, see the plugin's [README](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/google_maps_flutter) page.
