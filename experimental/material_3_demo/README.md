# Material 3 Demo

This sample Flutter app showcases the updated Material 3 components in the Flutter Material library. These components currently include IconButtons and Chips. The app supports light and dark themes, different color palettes, as well as the ability to switch between Material 2 and Material 3. For more information about Material 3, the guidance is now live at https://m3.material.io/.

This app only showcases the components in the Flutter master channel and will be migrated to the non-experimental directory in the samples repo once they get ready in the stable branch.
