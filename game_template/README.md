# game_template

A tiny game in Flutter with all the bells and whistles
of a mobile (iOS & Android) game:

- sound
- music
- main menu screen
- settings
- ads (AdMob)
- in-app purchases
- games services (Game Center & Google Play Games Services)
- crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)


## Getting started

The game compiles and works out of the box. It comes with things
like a main menu, a router, a settings screen, and audio.
When starting your gamedev project, that is likely everything you will need.

When you're ready to enable the more advanced integrations, like ads
and in-app payments, read the _Integrations_ section below.


## Development

To run the app in debug mode:

    flutter run

This assumes you have an Android emulator, iOS Simulator or a physical
device attached.

It is often convenient to develop your game as a desktop app.
For example, you can run `flutter run -d macOS`, and get the same UI
in a desktop window on a Mac. That way, you don't need to be running
Simulators nor attaching mobile devices. This template supports that
method of development: integrations like AdMob will be disabled then.


### Code organization

Code is organized in a loose and shallow feature-first fashion.
In `lib/src`, you'll therefore find directories such as `ads`, `audio`
or `main_menu`. Nothing fancy, but usable.

The state management approach is intentionally low-level. That way, it's easy to
take this project and run with it, without having to learn new paradigms, or having
to remember to run `flutter pub run build_runner watch`. You are,
of course, encouraged to use whatever paradigm, helper package or code generation
scheme to build on top of this project.


### Building for production

To build the app for iOS (and open Xcode when finished):

    flutter build ipa && open build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive

To build the app for Android (and open the folder with the bundle when finished):

    flutter build appbundle && open build/app/outputs/bundle/release

While the template is meant for mobile games, you can also publish
for the web. This might be useful for web-based demos, for example,
or for rapid play-testing. The following command requires `peanut`
to be [installed](https://pub.dev/packages/peanut/install).

    flutter pub global run peanut \
    --web-renderer canvaskit \
    --extra-args "--base-href=/name_of_your_github_repo/" \
    && git push origin --set-upstream gh-pages

The last line of the command above will automatically push 
your newly built web game to GitHub pages, assuming that you have
that set up.


## Integrations

The more advanced integrations are disabled by default. For example,
achievements are not enabled at start because you, the developer, first
have to set them up (the achievements need to exist in App Store Connect
and Google Play Console before they can be used in the code).

In this section, you will find instructions on what to do to enable 
any given integration.


### Ads

Ads are implemented via the official `package:google_mobile_ads` and
are disabled by default. The `AdsController` provided from
`lib/main.dart` is `null`, and so the template gracefully falls back
to not showing ads.

You will find code relating to ads in `lib/src/ads/`.

To enable ads in your game:

1. Go to [AdMob][] and set up an account.
   This could take a significant amount of time because you need to provide
   banking information, sign contracts and so on.
2. Create two _Apps_ in [AdMob][]: one for Android and one for iOS.
3. Get the AdMob _App IDs_ for both the Android app and the iOS app.
   You will find these in the _App settings_ section. They look
   something like `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890`
   (note the tilde between the two numbers).
4. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, find the `<meta-data>`
   entry called `com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID`,
   and update the value with the _App ID_ of the Android AdMob app.
5. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, find the
   entry called `GADApplicationIdentifier`,
   and update the value with the _App ID_ of the iOS AdMob app.
6. Back in [AdMob][], create an _Ad unit_ for each of the AdMob apps.
   This will ask for the Ad unit's format (Banner, Interstitial, Rewarded).
   The template is set up for a Banner ad unit, so select that if you
   want to avoid making changes to the code in `lib/src/ads`.
7. Get the _Ad unit IDs_ for both the Android app and the iOS app.
   You will find these in the _Ad units_ section. They look
   something like `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456/1234567890`
   (yes, the format is very similar to _App ID_; note the slash
   between the two numbers).
8. Open `lib/src/ads/ads_controller.dart` and update the values
   of the _Ad unit_ ID there.
9. Uncomment the code relating to ads in `lib/main.dart`. You will
   need to add two imports, too:
   
   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';
   import 'package:google_mobile_ads/google_mobile_ads.dart';
   ```
10. Register the devices you will be using to test
   in [AdMob][]'s _Settings_ &rarr; _Test devices_ section.

[AdMob]: https://admob.google.com/

If you feel lost at any point, a full [AdMob for Flutter walk-through][]
is available on Google AdMob's documentation site.

[AdMob for Flutter walk-through]: https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/quick-start

If you want to implement more of AdMob's formats (such as Interstitial ads),
a good place to start are the examples in
[`package:google_mobile_ads`](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads).

### Audio

Audio is enabled by default and ready to go. You can modify code
in `lib/src/audio/` to your liking.

You will find some music
tracks in `assets/music` â€” these are Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)
licensed, and included in this repository with permission. If you decide
to keep these tracks in your game, please don't forget to give credit
to the musician, [Mr Smith][].

[Mr Smith]: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/mr-smith

The repository also includes a few sound effect samples in `assets/sfx`.
These are public domain (CC0) and you will almost surely want to replace
them because they're just Filip Hracek doing silly sounds with his mouth.

### Crashlytics

Crashlytics integration is disabled by default. But even if you don't
enable it, you might find code in `lib/src/crashlytics` helpful.
It gathers all log messages and errors, so that you can, at the very least,
print them to the console.

To enable Firebase Crashlytics, do the following:

1. Create a new project in
   [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   You can call the Firebase project whatever you like; just remember the name.
   You don't need to enable Analytics in the project if you don't want to.
2. [Install `firebase-tools`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#setup_update_cli)
   on your machine.
3. [Install `flutterfire` CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli#installation)
   on your machine.
4. In the root of this project (the directory containing `pubspec.yaml`),
   run the following:
    - `flutterfire configure`
        - This command will ask you about the name of the Firebase project
          that you created earlier, and about the target platforms you want
          to support. As of April 2022, only `android` and `ios` are fully
          supported by Crashlytics.
        - The command will rewrite `lib/firebase_options.dart` with
          the correct code.
5. Go to `lib/main.dart` and uncomment the lines that relate to Crashlytics.

Now you should be able to see crashes, errors and 
severe log messages in
[console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
To test this out, add a button to your project, and just throw whatever
exception you like when the player presses it.

```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () => throw StateError('whoa!'),
  child: Text('Test Crashlytics'),
)
```


### Games Services (Game Center & Google Play Games Services)

TBA

### In-app purchase

TBA

### Settings

The settings page is enabled by default, and accessible both
from the main menu and via the "gear" button in the play session screen.

Settings are saved to local storage via `package:shared_preferences`.
To change what preferences are saved and how, edit files in
`lib/src/settings/persistence`.

## Icon

To update the launcher icon, first change the files
`assets/icon-adaptive-foreground.png` and `assets/icon.png`.
Then, run the following:

    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main

You can configure the look of the icon in the `flutter_icons:`
section of `pubspec.yaml`.
