# web_embedding

This directory contains examples of how to embed Flutter in web apps (without iframes):

* **element_embedding_demo**: Modifies the index.html of a flutter app so it is
  launched in a custom `hostElement`. This is the most basic embedding example.
* **ng-flutter**: A simple Angular app (and component) that replicates the above
  example, but in an Angular style.
* **cra-flutter**: A simple React app (and component) that replicates the above
  example, but in a React style.

Check the `README.md` of each example for more details on how to run it, and the
"Points of Interest" it may contain.
